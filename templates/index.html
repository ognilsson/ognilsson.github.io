                    I'm a sophomore at Harvard University pursuing a BS degree in Mechanial Engineering and I'm also interested in
                    Physics, Computer Science, and Environmental Engineering.
                    I'm originally from Uppsala, Sweden, where I've lived my whole life until moving to the US for college.
                    One of my favorite extracurricular activities is playing Soccer. I play as a goalkeeper and am a member of Harvard Men's Soccer Varsity team.
