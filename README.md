Final Project

# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Microjournaling

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A wellness webite where users will inout hteir overall happiness and activities during a day, and will then be able to see data
on their overall happiness trend as well as what activities genereally makes them feel good.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Users will have to create an account and login in via a login page each time they visit the website. The user will then ba able to access
a page where the user inputs their overall happiness (on a scale 1-5), what activities they did during the day, and some overall reflections about the day.
The ser can access each previous day's responses under an "Entries" page. They will also be able to see statistics like overall happiness ver time and
average overall feeling under a "Statistics" page. Lastly, the website will also reccomend activities that genereally makes the user happy.
This will be achieved by using algorothms we create based on basic statistsic. We hope this webiste will help people be more aware of what makes them happy
and that they consequently can seek out those activities more often, especially as COVID continues to damage mental health over the world.

## If planning to combine CS50's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to CS50, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TFs below.

George Nageeeb
gnageeb@college.harvard.edu     TF: Johnny Zhang

Galen Lewis
galenlewis@college.harvard.edu      TF: James Conant

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A website that allows users to track their overall feeling over time by displaying it graphically.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A "smarter" website that also gives the user some suggestions on what he'she might want to do in order to make them MORE happy, i.e. recommend activities that
generally are associated with happy days.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Help the user actually perform these good activities more often by letting the user plan in a calendar when he/she will do that activity and keep a record
of it is fullfilled (Essentially help build a habbit).

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

We need to figure out what questions are most effective to ask the user. We also need to set up the basic structure of our application where data is securely saved
so that user can trust it. I will focus (initially) on the journal entry part, George will focus on the diagnostic part, and Galen on presenting our stats in
user friendly ways. Hopefully we can also incorporate any COVID specific insight on mental health we might gain during the process.
